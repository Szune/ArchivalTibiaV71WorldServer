# Archival Tibia 7.1 World Server
Written as part of a bigger project to learn more about the Tibia 7.1 client, mostly for fun, archival purposes and nostalgia.

*Disclaimer:* Severely lacking in error handling and security, it is still a work in progress and it is very unlikely that it will ever handle malicious packets, as this project is not intended to be used to host a private Tibia 7.1 server publicly.

Packets currently (at least partly) handled by the server can be found under /ArchivalTibiaV71WorldServer/PacketHandlers/

Info about file structures can currently only be found by going through the code, when I have the time I will create a wiki and add them there.

*Note:* This is only the world server, the login server will be found in [ArchivalTibiaV71LoginServer](https://github.com/Szune/ArchivalTibiaV71LoginServer).
